# PHP-unit-converter

This is another unit converter, but this one utilizes PHP instead of javascript. It converts between Astronomical Units and Kilometers.
The index file with partial code was provided from my professor in my Intro to Internet Computing Class. It was modified to convert to 
these different units. The design layout was a bootstrap package from http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/. I have included 
their license that came with the design package.
